# Sayonika Server

This repository contains the Sayonika server code.

Sayonika server is built with Express and :heart: and runs along with a API Gateway instance, like Janus.

## Running

Sayonika requires `vertx` to be ran. Go to the [Download](https://vertx.io/download/) page if you haven't.

## Contributing

We use JavaScript for coding the server. You are required to follow the coding style set on our repository.

We rely on [Janus](https://github.com/hellofresh/janus) for the Gateway system. Please consult their repository
if you find something off on the gateway, not here.
